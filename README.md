## Bear and Bees Game 

***
## General Info
This game was created for Lab 2 in F28WP Web Programming. The game descripion is as follows (as shown on the lab sheet);

  "The characters are bees and a bear. The bees fly randomly in all directions to attack the bear.
  The bear is controlled by the user and can move up, down, left, and right while staying in the
  game board to avoid being bitten by bees.
  The objective of the player is to minimize the number of stings. The winner is the player who
  manages to have less stings.
  The user must be able to adjust, on the run, the speed of the bees and the frequency of the game
  update loop. They can also restart the game and set any the number of bees to play with. Bees
  appear at random positions in the board and move continuously and randomly in the four
  directions.
  The application should detect any sting (overlap between a bee and the bear images). The
  number of stings is displayed continuously. The duration between two stings is also calculated.
  The longest period without stings is kept as the best score. The largest duration is displayed
  and refreshed every time it changes. The user can add bees at any time without restarting the
  game."
  
Activites in this lab concentrates on client-side programming using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Objects, Arrays and DOM API. The game does not involve server interactions.
